# BrainHack2020 - RBG Trees
**Task**
There's 2 main components:
  1. Image recognition (CV)  
  2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
  
Work within the folder for the component you are on.  

More information are in the notebook, either you can create new ones (by naming it as submission +1) or clone the files, as we want to keep track of previous submussion to track what have we done.

SCORING AND LEADERBOARD - CV
1. CV will be evaluated using mAP, and you will need to submit your JSON files by the
following timings for the interim and final evaluations:
- Interim Evaluation 1: 13 June 2020 (Sat), 1400h
- Interim Evaluation 2: 17 June 2020 (Wed), 1400h
- Final Evaluation: 20 June 2020 (Sat), 1400h
2. The submission site will be shared via MS Teams at a later date.
3. The CV evaluation datasets will be released at the following timings:
- Interim Evaluations: 1,000 images will be released on 13 June 2020 (Sat), 1200h
- Final Evaluation: 1,500 images will be released on 20 June 2020 (Sat), 1200h

SCORING AND LEADERBOARD - NLP
1. NLP will be evaluated using AUC-ROC score by submitting through Kaggle, where you
may see live scoring and leaderboard for the NLP component.
2. We will be providing word embeddings (instead of text), which is intended to save effort
on data pre-processing. This also means that you may not need to source for open
datasets for the NLP component.
